The aim of this project is as follows: (written 2/21/22)
-Create a web scraper which searches for and returns pdf menus with some given parameters
-House the web scraper on a server written in Django
-Web server takes the menu, converts it to binary, cleans the data, feeds it to an ML module
-ML module separates the Menu into strings: Dish, description, cost, features (initially, I am thinking vegan, vegetarian, gf, etc.)
-Server populates a database with the information, to be used in the way my project under restaurant_final uses its database

If I can achieve this, I will re-evaluate and decide what to do next.
